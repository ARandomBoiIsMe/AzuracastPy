Configuring :class:`.AzuracastClient`
=====================================

:class:`.AzuracastClient` can be configured in one of two ways:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    configuration/ini
    configuration/keyword_args

The :doc:`configuration/ini` method has the higher priority of the two methods. Its values will
override those of the :doc:`configuration/keyword_args` method.
